description: All the data indexed by EASIN from distributed data sources e.g. used
  by the widget framework are made available via the interoperable web-services. The
  services were implemented respecting various open standards, i.e. freely available
  specifications and rules, such as OpenSearch, OGC, and TDWG. Using open standards
  ensures interoperability among different software products made by different manufacturers.
  These principles mean that users can implement custom solutions without having any
  knowledge of the service providers. This facilitates just-in-time integration and
  allows users to implement new ideas easily and dynamically. Most of the EASIN web
  services use the RESTful approach and return requested data as XML. The mapping
  service is built upon OGC WMS 1.3.0 standard, which allows easy integration into
  users&rsquo; mapping applications. In addition, each map layer is accompanied with
  INSPIRE compliant metadata.
